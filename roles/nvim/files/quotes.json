I did ask a teacher what did \"Knowledge is power, France is bacon\" mean and got a full 10-minute explanation of the \"knowledge is power\" bit but nothing on \"France is bacon\". When I prompted further explanation by saying \"France is bacon?\" in a questioning tone I just got a \"yes\". At 12 I didn't have the confidence to press it further.
